First Odin Project

Preamble: 
This is the first real project in the Odin curriculum. While it most certainly will be the most basic of the course, the fundamentals taken from it will be invaluable for the rest of the journey. I aim to improve my grasp on basic html formulation and implimentation, most specifically relative links as that is my weak point at the moment. See you on the other side!
