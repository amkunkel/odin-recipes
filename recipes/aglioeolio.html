        <h3>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, (photo 
            <a href="https://scheckeats.com/spaghetti-aglio-e-olio/">source</a>)</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients (for 2 servings)</h4>
        <ul>    
            <li>1/2 lb. Spaghetti (get the nice stuff like De Cecco at the least)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>~ 6 Large cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>~ 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsely</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Do not fill the pot to the brim
                since we want the water to be starchy when we make our sauce.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Thinly slice the garlic and chop parsely (stems removed) 
                to desired size and keep them separated. Ideally you want the 
            garlic to look like thin, little disks.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Cook spaghetti to according to package instructions minus one minute, since 
                we will be finishing the noodles in the sauce.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>With a few minutes left on the spaghetti, heat olive oil in large, deep
                skillet on medium heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Add garlic and pepper flakes, cook until garlic is a light,
                golden brown while stiring constantly to ensure even cooking of the 
                garlic.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>As pasta finishes cooking, reserve a large container of pasta water
                and add ~ 1/4 cup of it to the skillet to stop the garlic from burning.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Start moving the pasta to the skillet while stiring constantly
                to emulcify the sauce and coat the noodles.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Reduce sauce over heat until it reaches a creamy-like state
                adding more pasta water as needed and stirring constantly.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Check for salt and add as needed, remove from heat and stir 
                in parsely.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Serve and enjoy!</p></li>
        </ol>
