        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>    
            <li>~ 2 lbs. Chicken breast</li>
            <li>Canola oil</li>
            <li>Regular breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Freshly grated parmesan</li>
            <li>All purpose flour</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Ground pepper</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Prep chicken by cleaning any excess fat or tendon and 
                chopping into nugget-sized pieces
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>If you are in a hurry and need to feed kids or drunk people
                immedietly, as I usually am, don't worry about brining the chicken as 
                a lot of online recipes call for to mimic some fast food chains.
                Making some homemade buffalo and/or honey mustard will help any lack of
                flavor that comes from ommitting the brine step. Personally, I think
                these come out just fine and for needing such little prep time.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>If you are worried about tough nuggs, you can always do the chicken
                parmesan method of covering the prepped chicken with plastic wrap and beating
                it with a hammer to flatten them. I have made these nuggs countless times both ways
                and have found the beaten nuggs to be slightly better. 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>After taking out all of your pent-up frustration on the chicken pieces,
                or not if you're some other kind of psycho. Put some flour in a high-rimmed 
                dish or bowl, coat each piece of chicken and set aside.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Prep the breading by combining ~ 1 1/2 cup bread crumbs, ~ 1/4 cup finely 
                grated parmesan (doing this with a block of parmesan is the only acceptable way),
                1 tablespoon of Kosher salt, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper,
                 and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder.</p>
                <p>This recipe for the breading should not be treated as gospel, one is 
                encouraged to mess with all the measurements to find a favorite combination.
                I personally add almost another 1/4 cup of parmesan and go overboard with the 
                garlic powder. I even throw in some ground cayenne when I am feeling fancy. 
                It will also be hard to maintain these exact measurements since I often buy
                too much chicken, run out of breading mid-prep and have to make more on the 
                fly. In that case I usually just eyeball it and it comes out alright (as long
                as I don't over do the salt).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Find another medium-ish sized bowl and whisk together 2 - 3 eggs. Much like 
                the breading you will likely need to whisk more mid-nugg-making.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>One by one, dunk the flour-coated nuggs in the egg until coated, then dunk 
                in the breading mixture until fully coated as well. Set aside all the nuggs on an 
                extra plate before starting to fry.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Similar to most people, I find deep-frying at home miserable. I found the least 
                frustrating way to achieve a deep-fry that doesn't leave an enormous mess is to use 
                our 9 inch cast iron and fill it about halfway full with canola oil and flip the chicken 
                at halfway through cooking. This leaves a much smaller quantity of oil to cleanup 
                afterward, and it is much easier to handle compared to large pot or duch oven. Heat the 
                the oil until it reaches about 350 degrees farenheight. You can also tell it's hot enough 
                when you put a wooden spoon in the oil and it starts bubbling around it.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Regardless of the bubbling or the temperature, you will likely mess up the first batch 
                of nuggs. As a way to mediate this, use a sacrificial nugg to test how long it takes to 
                cook the size of nugg you chose. For me, it takes about 5 minutes per side before the middle 
                is cooked through. I test this by taking the largest one from a batch and cut it in half 
                before removing all of them. Work in batches trying not to overcrowd the pan to allow 
                each one to cook properly. Another way to ensure even cooking is to move the nuggs around 
                part-way through in case there are any hotspots. 
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Remove each batch of nuggs and place on a wire rack to dry before serving. 
                I usually have to serve them in batches since the prep work takes a long time 
                and the drunk people become impatient so I never worry about serving any cold nuggs.
                You can preheat the oven and place the wire rack on top of a sheet pan in there 
                inbetween batches to keep the early ones warm for serving them all at once.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Prep any sauces then serve and enjoy!</p></li>
