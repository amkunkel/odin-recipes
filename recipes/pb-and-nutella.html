        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>    
            <li>White sandwich bread (when you add nutella what is the point of
                using whole grain)
            </li>
            <li>Peanut butter of choice</li>
            <li>Nutella</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Choice of fruit, we like bananas (optional but worth it)</li>
            <li>Vanilla icecream (optional but even more worth it)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Spread butter on both sides of each slice of bread for one 
                sandwhich. Make sure to soften the butter so it is easily spreadable 
                onto room temperature bread.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Slice chosen fruit so that it will easily fit in the sandwhich.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Spread peanut butter on one side of one of the slices of bread,
                do the same with the nutella. Amount is up to personal preference.
                Place fruit on one slice of bread and assemble sandwich.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Melt ~ 1/2 tablespoon of butter on a cast iron skillet or any 
                heavy pan over medium-high heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Once hot, place assembled sandwhich in pan and press with a 
                spatula to flatten, but not destroy the sandwhich.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Cook until bread is toasted to desired level and then flip to 
                repeat the previous step.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Place the hot sandwhich in a bowl and immedietly top with vanilla 
                icecream so some melting occurs.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Serve and enjoy!</p></li>
        </ol>
